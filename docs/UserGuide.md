* Items inside round brackets are optional
  * e.g. in delete *n/task_name (d/date)*, a user can choose to include the date for the task if there are multiples of it

* In user inputted commands:
  * Items with n/ before them represent the exact name of the task
  * Items with tg/ before them represent the tag of the task
  * Items with d/ before them represent the date of the task
