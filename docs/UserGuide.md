## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

Welcome to the Uni-Fy User Guide!

Uni-Fy is a **desktop app for managing your university workload** and it is designed **by university students for university students**. 
This application is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) 
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, Uni-Fy can get your tasks to display faster than traditional GUI apps.

Interested to jump right in? Take a look at [**3. Getting started**](#3-getting-started). Enjoy!

* Items inside round brackets are optional
   * e.g. in <code>delete <i>n/task_name (d/date)</i></code>, a user can choose to include the date for the task if there are multiples of it

* In user inputted commands:
   * Items with <code>n/</code> before them represent the exact name of the task
