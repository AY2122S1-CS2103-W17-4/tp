* **Uni-fy** is a personal assistant app aimed to help students keep track of the many activities happening throughout their academic years.
* We aim to help students schedule and prioritise their numerous academic tasks to allow them to have more control over their time through the use of **Uni-Fy**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
